# XRP Price Prediction using Gradient Boosting Regressor and Time Series Cross-Validation
This repository contains an experimental approach to predict XRP (Ripple) cryptocurrency prices using the Gradient Boosting Regressor model and Time Series Cross-Validation.


## Installation
To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Dataset
The XRP historical price data should be in CSV format. Download it from a reliable data provider like Yahoo Finance or any other source that provides historical cryptocurrency price data. Save the file as 'xrp.csv'.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the directory containing the 'xrp_price_prediction.py' file.
2. Update the file path in the pd.read_csv() function in 'xrp_price_prediction.py' to the correct path where you saved the 'xrp.csv' file on your local machine.
3. Run the following command (file name will vary):

```sh
python xrp_price_prediction.py
```

The code will output the predicted closing prices for the next 30 days.

## Disclaimer
Please note that the code provided in this repository is experimental and not a finished product. It should be used as a starting point for further development and refinement. The predictions generated by this code should not be used for real market trading without thorough testing and validation. The code might or might not work depending on various factors, such as the availability of certain libraries like TensorFlow on your machine. Use this code at your own risk.
